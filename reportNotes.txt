To get the best results for both algorithms, each algorithm was run 5 times.

EXPLAIN WHAT PHEROMONES ARE 
Total Execution

1 second spent updating pheromones - You don't want to optimize the laying of pheromones 

makeNextMove spends roughly 8 seconds looking for the next move -- you want to improve performance on something worth doing - i.e. the gain achieved from performance critical functions make them more worth optimizing. Most of the time is spent in this function, so we want to optimize this. Removing nested for loops - by storing traversed cities in a Set - memoizing the cities that have not been visited by removing the visited cities from a set so you don't have to loop through them

You store a list of tour and remaining cities. Everytime you add something to the tour, you remove it from the remaining cities.
beta_component is exponentiation and this takes a long time to compute, so you need to remove it from the performance critical code. The beta component are both dependent on the beta and edge distances, which are all constant. So you memoize this at the beginning of the simulation.

Alpha and beta are real parameters whose values determine the relative importance: alpha controls the influence of the amount of pheromone on a trail and beta controls the influence of the heuristic information (the desirability of the edge, 1/d). Pheromones are evaporated from the trail on every iteration. As ants pick the edges and traverse them, they lay more pheromones, edges that have had no ants traverse them will then have less and less pheromones.

Advantages: Can be used in dynamic applications; however, the algorithm, being probabilistic, will change by iteration. As such, the time to converge, along with the quality of the soluiton, cannot be guaranteed, unlike the 3/2 approximation algorithm proposed by Christofides in 1976.

######################### SIMULATED ANNEALING -- THIS IS TOUR A ############################

Experimentation is in the cooling schedule. Using a geometric cooling schedule

SA is time-consuming due to efforts to not be caught in local minima.

Fred W. Glover, Gary A. Kochenberger - 2003; Springer Science & Business Media: Handbook of Metaheuristics
Tried to experiment with different cooling schedules -- geometric vs linear, however, experiments by Strenski and Kirkpatrick (1991) show that there is no measurable performance differences between linear and geometric ooling schedules. However, geometric cooling schedules are not greatly affected by excessively high initial temperatures and thus should be used particularly in such cases. Ultimately, it has been conjectured that the neighbourhood and the corresponding topology of objective functions that are responsible for the behavior of the simulated annealing algorithm, as the effectiveness of cooling schedules can only be compared through experimentation.

EXPLAIN WHAT 3-OPT IS
You modify the graph at each iteration and if it improves the results then you take the new one; otherwise, use the non-increasing function to decide if you should accept these changes. This is a slight modification to the usual simulated annealing algorithm which chooses a random neighbour and then decides if the algorithm should choose to move to this neighbour (which yields a worse solution) to break out of the local optimum.

Alfa A.S, Heragu S.S., Chen M. (1991): A 3-Opt Based Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Vehicle Routing Problems
3-opt method is a link exchange algorithm, which is used in this implementation of the TSP. Find a feasible tour, select any three links on this tour and replace them with any other three links not in the tour, but which would improve the cost of the tour. The solution is then obtained when an improved solution cannot be generated by replacing three links in the tour with three others not yet in the tour. However, the 3-opt version of simulated annealing is unable to outperform the Lin-Kernighan heuristic, which is a generalization of the 3-opt based on k-opt transitions, with k being decided dynamically

The cooling schedule is a slowly decreasing function which makes the swapping of edges less likely as time goes on, unless the tour has a shorter length after swapping, making it more difficult for the algorithm to escape a local minimum.
